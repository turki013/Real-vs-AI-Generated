🔁 Note on Duplicates


A few tweets appear more than once — that’s intentional.


We applied controlled oversampling to ensure each celebrity had exactly 15 examples. This prevents class imbalance and helps machine learning models generalize more accurately, especially in beginner projects.

💡 Fun Facts


- Some tweets were generated using GPT-style prompts to match the celebrity's voice.
- This dataset was used in a hackathon project called TweetLike — a web app where you guess the celebrity based on a tweet and find out how AI can trick you.
