🐦 Celebrity Tweets Dataset (Real vs AI-Generated)


This dataset contains 120 tweets from 8 well-known celebrities, a mix of real tweets and AI-generated imitations. Each tweet is labeled to support machine learning projects, particularly in the areas of text classification, stylistic analysis, and authorship prediction.

🔁 Note on Duplicates


A few tweets appear more than once — that’s intentional.


We applied controlled oversampling to ensure each celebrity had exactly 15 examples. This prevents class imbalance and helps machine learning models generalize more accurately, especially in beginner projects.

💡 Fun Facts


- Some tweets were generated using GPT-style prompts to match the celebrity's voice.
- This dataset was used in a hackathon project called TweetLike — a web app where you guess the celebrity based on a tweet and find out how AI can trick you.
